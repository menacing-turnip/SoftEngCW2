DELETE EVERYTHING YOU HAVE (unless your name is Manuel - keep a copy of SET FLOOR PLAN PAGE)

download all as zip and open Software_Engineering_CW2 folder in vs code

Go to powershell and write following commands

cd ezpzpark

npm install react-scripts (you will have deleted modules so you'll need to reinstall but make sure you are in the ezpzpark directory)

npm install json-server

npx json-server --watch src\ezpzparkdb.json --port 8000

OPEN NEW POWERSHELL TERMINAL

npm start

Good luck. Try not to suck.
