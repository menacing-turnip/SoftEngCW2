DELETE EVERYTHING YOU HAVE (unless your name is Manuel - keep a copy of work already done and try to assimilate)

download all as zip and open Software_Engineering_CW2 folder in vs code

Go to powershell and write following commands

cd ezpzpark

npm install react-scripts (you will have deleted modules so you'll need to reinstall but make sure you are in the ezpzpark directory)

npm start

The site will load in your default browser - TO ACCESS THE ADMIN AND DRIVER DASHBOARD PAGES JUST CLICK "SUBMIT" BUTTON
ON THE LOGIN PAGES (NO NEED TO INPUT ANYTHING AS BACKEND NOT IMPLEMENTED) I HAVE LEFT WHAT I HOPE ARE HELPFUL HINTS
ON HOW TO IMPLEMENT THE BACKEND ON ALL PAGES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN CODED YET - I DID THE CSS FILES FOR AS MANY PAGES AS I COULD
AND ALL BUTTONS NOW WORK - THE "HOME" BUTTON ON THE NAV BAR WILL ALWAYS TAKE YOU BACK TO THE MAIN MAIN PAGE BUT EVENTUALLY
IF THE SYSTEM KNOWS THAT A USER IS A DRIVER THE HOME BUTTON WILL GO TO THE DRIVER DASHBOARD AND IF ITS AN ADMIN USER THE 
ADMIN DASHBOARD BUT NO NEED TO WORRY TOO HARD ABOUT THIS - FOCUS ON CSS FIRST BACKEND SECOND

Good luck. Try not to suck.
