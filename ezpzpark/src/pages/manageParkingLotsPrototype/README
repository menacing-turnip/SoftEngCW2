This folder contains the managing parking lot system that was unfortunately unable to be integrated into the PMS website. In this folder, you
must run 'text.html' to see how the 'managing parking lot' park would have worked inside the PMS website. I implemented the ability to add and
remove parking spaces and store them in an array of 'ParkingSpace' objects, which would be saved in the .json backend file and be available for
the driver users to reserve or occupy. There is also the feature of adding and removing parking lots, so that the admin has the ability to manage
multiple parking lots and replicate them as accurately as possible. The parking lots are also stored in an array of 'ParkingLot' objects, which
would have also been saved in the .json backend file, and be available for the driver users to select which parking lot they will be using. The
system also allows the parking spaces to have 4 states: Free (available to drivers to park in), Occupied (in use by a driver), Reserved (booked
reserved for a driver for future usage), and Blocked (unavailable for anyone). Any parking space can be clicked on and blocked/unblocked with the
pop-up div element. The parking spaces for the third parking lot have their states randomised for the sake of showcasing this state feature.
